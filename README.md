Python API for 1Broker

1Broker provides Forex and CFD trading with bitcoin.  They can be accessed here:
https://1broker.club

This Python API allows you to access their services programatically.

This is a Python repository with three files:
* HttpMD5Util.py - Used for HttpGet calls
* broker1_api.py - Provides a complete library of all 1Broker APIs
* broker1_example.py - Test script to exercise the API completely (a minor amount of bitcoin is needed to test trades)

You will need to set the variable "token" in the top of broker1_api.py with your 1Broker API token which is found on their website under Account Settings -> API Tokens.
