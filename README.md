# 1Broker R API
R API for 1Broker (version 2 of their API)

1Broker provides Forex and CFD trading with bitcoin.  They can be accessed here:
https://1broker.com/?r=3981

You will need to set the variable "token" in the top of 1brokerv2_test.R with your 1Broker API token which is found on their website under "Access & API Management".

We have two files:
* 1broker.R - Provides a complete library of all 1Broker API calls
* 1brokerv2_test.R - Test script to exercise the API completely (a minor amount of bitcoin is needed to test trades)

Python API provided here: https://github.com/SatoshiReport/1Broker-Python-API
